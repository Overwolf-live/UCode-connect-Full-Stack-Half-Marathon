    <p> Doom Eternal is a first-person shooter game developed by id Software and published by Bethesda Softworks. 
      The sequel to Doom (2016), and the fifth main game in the Doom series, it was released on March 20, 2020, 
      for Windows, PlayStation 4, Stadia and Xbox One, with a version for Nintendo Switch being released on 
      December 8, 2020 and versions for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and Series S being planned. Set some 
      time after the events of the 2016 game, the story follows the Doom Slayer once again, on a mission to 
      end Hell's consumption of Earth and foil the alien Maykrs' plans to exterminate humanity.
      Along with the single-player campaign, a multiplayer mode titled "Battlemode" was introduced. In this mode,
      players can either play as the Doom Slayer or as a demon, and fight until either the Doom Slayer defeats 
      the demons, or vice versa. Another mode, titled "Invasion", is currently in development. Players will be 
      able to join other player's single-player campaigns and fight each other. On October 20, 2020, a standalone
      campaign DLC, titled The Ancient Gods - Part One, was released, taking place after the events of the main campaign.
      Upon release, Doom Eternal received critical acclaim, with praise for its campaign, graphics, level design, 
      soundtrack and combat mechanics, though some disliked the increased focus on storytelling and its platforming 
      sections. Doom Eternal received five nominations at The Game Awards for 2020, including Game of the Year and 
      Best Action Game. <br>

      Players once again take on the role of the Doom Slayer who battles the demonic forces of Hell, from a 
      first-person perspective. The game continues its predecessor's emphasis on "push-forward" combat, 
      encouraging the player to aggressively engage enemies in order to acquire health, ammo, and armor. 
      The player has access to various firearms, such as the Combat Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Heavy Cannon, 
      Rocket Launcher, Plasma Rifle, Chaingun, BFG 9000, and Ballista. Melee weapons such as a chainsaw, 
      the "Crucible Blade" energy sword and a retractable arm-blade called the "Doomblade" can also be used. 
      The arm-blade provides the opportunity for a larger variety of quick and violent "glory kill" executions, 
      which drop extra health. The Super Shotgun is now equipped with the "Meat Hook", a ranged accessory which 
      grabs on to enemies and slingshots the player towards them, functioning as a grappling hook, useful both 
      in combat scenarios and environmental navigation. The Doom Slayer's armor now includes a shoulder-mounted 
      Equipment Launcher with the ability to lob grenades and ice bombs. Additional to it is the Flame Belch, a 
      flame thrower which sets enemies on fire with it to drop armor pickups. Finally, killing enemies with the 
      chainsaw will drop ammunition. New movement mechanics such as wall-climbing, dash moves, and horizontal 
      bars to swing from have also been introduced. <br>

      Creative director Hugo Martin has stated there would be twice as many demon types as in the 2016 reboot. 
      There are new types of enemies, such as the Marauder and Doom Hunter, while others, such as the Pain Elemental, 
      Arachnotron, and Archvile, have been reintroduced from previous Doom entries. A new system called "Destructible 
      Demons" is featured, in which enemies' bodies become progressively destroyed and deteriorated in combat as they 
      suffer damage. Through this system, certain parts of a demon's anatomy can be destroyed to eliminate their ability 
      to use their stronger attacks. There is also a new lives system. During gameplay, players can collect 1-up items 
      (which look like green helmets) scattered around the environment. When the Doom Slayer perishes in combat, he will 
      respawn where he died if he has spare lives, instead of restarting at the nearest checkpoint.</p>
